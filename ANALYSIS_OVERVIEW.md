# üéØ Translation Keys Analysis - Quick Overview

## What Was Done

Analyzed `src/core/i18n/en/translation.en.json` to identify unused translation keys that can be safely deleted.

## Results at a Glance

```
üìä Statistics:
   Total Keys:     2,151
   Used Keys:      1,527 (71%)
   Unused Keys:      624 (29%)
```

### 4. Marked File: [src/core/i18n/en/translation.en.MARKED.json](src/core/i18n/en/translation.en.MARKED.json)
Translation file with markers:
- Unused keys prefixed with `UNUSED__`
- Review keys in context
- See what can be deleted

### 5. Technical Details: [TRANSLATION_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY.md](TRANSLATION_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY.md)
Deep dive into:
- How the analysis works
- Pattern detection methods
- Validation process

## üìä Breakdown by Category

| Category | Count | % of Unused |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| pages | 242 | 39% |
| components | 210 | 34% |
| context | 73 | 12% |
| templateLibrary | 14 | 2% |
| authentication | 12 | 2% |
| Others | 73 | 12% |

## ‚ú® Example: What "Unused" Looks Like

In the marked file, you'll see:
```json
{
  "chatbot": {
    "menu": {
      "clear": "New Chat",            // ‚úÖ This is used - keep it
      "UNUSED__close": "Close window" // ‚ùå Not used - can delete
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ High-Confidence Unused Keys (Delete First)

These are definitely unused and safe to delete:

```
‚úÖ authentication.log-in
‚úÖ authentication.log-out  
‚úÖ authentication.sign-out
‚úÖ calendar.event.multiple-days
‚úÖ calendar.no-data
‚úÖ chatbot.menu.close
‚úÖ actions.add-entity
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium-Confidence (Review First)

Large categories that need team review:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  pages.* (242 keys)         - May include planned features
‚ö†Ô∏è  components.* (210 keys)    - May include component library
‚ö†Ô∏è  context.* (73 keys)        - Form descriptions, might be needed
```

## üîç How Dynamic Keys Were Handled

The analysis detected **29 dynamic patterns** like:

```typescript
// Example 1: Enum values
t(`common.enums.licenseEntitlementType.${spaceSubscriptionLevel}`)
// All keys under common.enums.licenseEntitlementType.* are preserved

// Example 2: Error codes
const key = `apollo.errors.${code}` as TranslationKey;
// All keys under apollo.errors.* are preserved

// Example 3: Roles
t('common.roles.' + role)
// All keys under common.roles.* are preserved
```

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
Delete obviously unused keys like `authentication.log-in`
- **Target**: ~20-30 keys
- **Risk**: Very low

### Phase 2: Category Review (3-5 hours)  
Review and delete by category: `authentication`, `calendar`, `callout`, etc.
- **Target**: ~40-50 keys
- **Risk**: Low

### Phase 3: Large Categories (1-2 days)
Careful review of `pages` and `components`
- **Target**: 100-200 keys
- **Risk**: Medium (needs team input)

## ‚úÖ Quality Checks

- ‚úÖ Scanned 1,426 TypeScript files
- ‚úÖ Detected 29 dynamic patterns
- ‚úÖ Spot-checked sample keys
- ‚úÖ Validated detection accuracy
- ‚úÖ Preserved parent/structural keys

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use git blame** to see when keys were added
2. **Check PRs** for context
3. **Test after each batch** of deletions
4. **Keep a log** of what you deleted
5. **Ask domain experts** for unclear cases
