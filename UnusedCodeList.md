# List of Files with Potentially Unused Code

Below is a list of files (based on static analysis and cross‐referencing in the src folder) that appear to contain code that is likely not used or could be removed/refactored:

1. **SpaceAboutPage.tsx (in about/)**

   - Contains duplicate logic and re-export patterns now superseded by the unified JourneyAboutPage.
   - Unused internal implementations may exist if only the unified component is referenced.

2. **SubspaceAboutPage.tsx (in about/)**

   - Similar to SpaceAboutPage, it duplicates functionality that is being consolidated in JourneyAboutPage.
   - Some state/handler code might no longer be in use across the application.

3. **SpaceAboutView.tsx (in admin/SpaceAboutSettings/)**

   - May include legacy patterns; portions of its update/submit logic could be redundant if the refactored unified “about” mechanism is used.

4. **AdminOpportunityCommunityPage.tsx (in admin/)**

   - Contains multiple calls to similar community admin hooks with overlapping functions.
   - Certain functions (or duplicates of “getAvailableVirtualContributors”) might not be invoked anywhere.

5. **OpportunitySettingsView.tsx (in admin/OpportunitySettings/)**

   - Some dialog and delete-handling logic are defined even though usage of the component or its elements in the app might be minimal.

6. **Legacy or Duplicate Routing Components**
   - Files under `routing/toReview2/SpaceSettingsRoute.tsx` or similar transitional routes may contain outdated or unused code.
   - A thorough check on these route files is recommended.

_Note:_ This list is based on a static inspection of component relationships and usage import patterns. A dynamic analysis (using tools such as a bundler’s dead-code elimination report or IDE usage insights) is recommended for a definitive clean-up.
