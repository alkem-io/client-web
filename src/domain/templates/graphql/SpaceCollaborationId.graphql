# TODO: This query shouldn't be needed. In fact, when we merge Entitlements PR#7003 we should remove it and just use useSpace().collaborationId
# In the end we need it for the CollaborationFromSpaceUrlForm, so this query should stay. But I leave the todo, because we need to remove the other usage when we merge 7003
