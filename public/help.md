# The structure of Alkemio

We can distinguish several levels on the Alkemio platform. The hierarchial order hereby is the **Alkemio platform** (a Hub of Hubs), **Challenge Hub**, **Challenge**, and **Opportunity**.

Each level has a **Community** around it. Individuals and Organizations can choose to join a Hub to contribute to multiple Challenges around a certain theme. It is also possible to join seperate Challenges in different Hubs.

Within all three levels, Users can discuss the topic, share relevant information in a structured manner, and brainstorm by using canvases.
