### Callout Inspiration

_Callouts are a way to **engage** your community and allow them to **contribute** with their knowledge and experiences. You can ask the community various questions to make progress. What kind of questions? That will depend on whether you are working in the Hub, Challenge, or Opportunity._

A **Hub** is a space to gather people around a set of Challenges and identify other related challenges. Callouts that therefore may be relevant are:

- Please introduce yourself!
- What should the content be for an upcoming webinar for this community?
- Do you have any suggestions for other Challenges related to this Hub?

Within a **Challenge**, you want to gather insights and identify opportunities:

- How does the ecosystem of this Challenge look like?
- Do you know any books or articles with relevant knowledge?
- Can you share some of your recent experiences while working on this Challenge?

On the **Opportunity** level, you want to gather resources to realize the opportunity and showcase what has been done:

- What are other related initiatives, tools or methods that this Opportunity can learn from?
- Do you know any potential funding partners?

### Callout types

_After thinking of the questions, you have to choose the best Callout type to get the answers from your Community._

- If you want it to be a low threshold way of answering, you can use **Discussions**. Members can submit a simple answer, such as introducing themselves or ideas for a webinar;
- **Cards** are a way to submit your knowledge, such as ideas, related initiatives, or relevant stakeholders, that require additional information. For example, a longer description, references, visuals, and allowing others to comment;
- Lastly, **Whiteboards**Â can be used to allow people to visualize their input, such as personas, stakeholder mapping, business models, etc.
