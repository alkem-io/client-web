# Implementation Plan: CRD Authentication Pages

**Branch**: `101-crd-auth-pages` | **Date**: 2026-05-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/101-crd-auth-pages/spec.md`

## Summary

Build CRD-styled equivalents of every MUI-only authentication screen (sign-in, both registration entry points, password recovery, set-new-password, email verification, the verification-reminder, and the auth-error fallback) and make the CRD auth flow the application's single authentication experience for every visitor. Authentication screens are shown before a user is authenticated, so there is no per-user context — they simply have one design. Visual treatment matches the supplied screenshots; backend behaviour is unchanged.

**Technical approach**: Reuse the existing Kratos data layer (`useKratosFlow`, `useReturnUrl`, all sibling auth hooks). Introduce a thin **flow-descriptor adapter** in the integration layer that turns Kratos `UiNode[]` arrays into plain TypeScript prop types so the new CRD presentational components stay clean of Kratos imports. Reproduce the MUI `KratosUI` node-grouping logic inside a new `CrdKratosFlow` component that consumes the adapted descriptor. Modify `IdentityRoute.tsx` to render the CRD route components directly for every `/identity/*` auth route — the auth routes are not conditional; the old MUI auth page components become orphaned dead code. Wrap every CRD auth screen in a brand-new shared `AuthShell` layout (full-bleed constellation background, right-aligned card, footer); the already-shipped `CrdAuthRequiredPage` is **not** refactored onto this shell (per spec clarification).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React 19 (with React Compiler), Node 24.14.0 (Volta-pinned)
**Primary Dependencies** (all existing — no new runtime deps):
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI) + Tailwind CSS v4 + `class-variance-authority` + `lucide-react` (CRD layer)
- `react-i18next` for the new `crd-auth` namespace
- `@ory/kratos-client` (already loaded by the existing MUI auth layer — stays in `src/core/auth/`)
- `react-router-dom` (integration layer only)
- Apollo Client — present in the app but **not used** by this feature (the auth flow has no GraphQL)
**Storage**: No new application-level preference or flag. Beyond Kratos's own session/cookie storage (and the pre-existing `returnUrl` handoff), the only key this feature writes is a transient per-tab `sessionStorage` entry for the registration accept-terms checkbox (`crd-auth-accepted-terms-<flowId>`), ported from the MUI screen because Kratos resets that trait on a validation-error re-render. It is per-tab and not persisted across browser restarts.
**Testing**: Vitest + `@testing-library/react` (jsdom). Per spec clarification, match the existing CRD-migration test pattern (unit tests on new CRD presentational components, integration tests on the new integration-layer route components / data adapters where peer migrated pages cover the equivalent surface). No new end-to-end Kratos tests.
**Target Platform**: Modern evergreen browsers (>90% caniuse coverage per project rule).
**Project Type**: Web SPA (single project; existing repository layout).
**Performance Goals**: No regression on the auth surface vs. MUI. The CRD bundle for these pages is lazy-loaded the same way every other migrated CRD page is.
**Constraints**:
- **Hard restriction**: every file under `src/crd/` MUST respect the CRD golden rules (no MUI, no business logic, no GraphQL types, no `react-router-dom`, no `formik`, no `@/core/auth/*` imports — see `src/crd/CLAUDE.md`).
- **Hard restriction**: every file under `src/main/crdPages/auth/` MUST NOT import from `@mui/*` or `@emotion/*` (the integration layer is MUI-free even though it sits outside `src/crd/`).
- **URL parity**: every `/identity/*` URL path must remain byte-identical to today (Kratos-issued emails contain these URLs).
- **Behaviour parity**: every field, error, redirect, and supported method must match the MUI version exactly; the backend is unchanged.
- **Observability parity** (FR-021, FR-022): same APM transaction wrapping and same analytics events as the MUI screens.
**Scale/Scope**: 8 user-facing auth screens to migrate × 6 supported languages (en, nl, es, bg, de, fr). Estimated ~8–12 new CRD presentational components + 1 new shared layout + 1 new flow-descriptor adapter + direct CRD route wiring in `IdentityRoute.tsx` (the auth routes are not conditional).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Compliance | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **I. Domain-Driven Frontend Boundaries** | ✅ Pass | All Kratos / domain logic stays in `src/core/auth/`; the integration layer in `src/main/crdPages/auth/` is the only place where Kratos types and CRD prop types meet (via the flow-descriptor adapter). CRD presentational components in `src/crd/components/auth/` know nothing about Kratos. |
| **II. React 19 Concurrent UX Discipline** | ✅ Pass | Form submission is a native `<form action method>` POST that Kratos handles via full-page navigation — it is inherently non-blocking and needs no `useTransition`/Actions wrapper (introducing one would be ceremony with no behavioural benefit). The only async data-fetch this feature renders is the initial Kratos flow load, handled by the reused `useKratosFlow` hook and presented with an explicit skeleton loading state so paint is never blocked. Rendering is pure; no deprecated lifecycle patterns introduced. |
| **III. GraphQL Contract Fidelity** | ✅ N/A | This feature introduces and consumes no GraphQL operations — the auth flow is entirely Kratos-driven. No codegen needed. |
| **IV. State & Side-Effect Isolation** | ✅ Pass | Persistent state stays in existing Apollo caches and Kratos cookies. CRD components hold visual-only `useState` (show/hide password, transient cooldown UI). The 30-second recovery cooldown's `sessionStorage` write stays in the integration layer; the CRD component receives a `submitDisabled` prop + `submitLabelOverride` callback. |
| **V. Experience Quality & Safeguards** | ✅ Pass | WCAG 2.1 AA enforced per `FR-019`, `FR-020`. APM + analytics parity per `FR-021`, `FR-022`. Tests follow the established CRD-migration pattern per `FR-023`. |
| **Architecture standards** | ✅ Pass | Files placed in canonical locations: `src/crd/` (design system), `src/main/crdPages/auth/` (integration), `src/core/auth/` untouched on the MUI side. Existing barrel-export ban respected — every new file is imported by explicit path. |
| **SOLID** | ✅ Pass | SRP: each CRD component renders one screen / one form region. OCP: the flow-descriptor adapter is parameterised by flow type, so adding a future Kratos node type extends without modifying existing screens. DIP: CRD components depend on the plain `KratosFlowDescriptor` abstraction, never on `@ory/kratos-client` types. |

**Result**: No violations. No entries needed in Complexity Tracking. Proceed to Phase 0.

```

**Structure Decision**: Mirror the existing CRD-migration layout used by every prior migrated page. Three layers, three locations: (a) the design system (`src/crd/`), (b) the integration glue (`src/main/crdPages/auth/`), (c) route wiring (extend `IdentityRoute.tsx`). The integration layer is the only place GraphQL/Kratos types meet CRD prop types. The CRD presentational components do not touch routing, Kratos, or auth context — every behaviour they need arrives as a callback prop.

## Implementation Sequence (recommended order of work)

This is plan-level guidance — `/speckit.tasks` will produce the formal task list. Order matters because some primitives unblock multiple screens.

1. **Foundations**:
   - `AuthShell` layout (every screen depends on it).
   - `PasswordField`, `EmailField`, `TextInputField`, `AcceptTermsCheckbox` form wrappers.
   - `SocialProviderButton`, `OrContinueWithDivider`, `AuthCardHeader` shared components.
   - `crd-auth` i18n namespace skeleton (English first; other languages added before merge).
   - `flowDescriptorAdapter.ts` and the `KratosFlowDescriptor` type contract.

2. **CrdKratosFlow** — the centrepiece. Reproduce the MUI `KratosUI` grouping logic against the descriptor (default → password → reset link → submit → divider → passkey/OIDC, with the login-specific icon-row vs. registration full-width-row split).

3. **Sign-in screen** (P1) — first usable slice. Point the `login` route in `IdentityRoute.tsx` directly at the CRD route component, prove the end-to-end pattern works against a real Kratos backend, smoke-test in browser.

4. **Sign-up screens** (P2) — both `/identity/sign_up` (curated minimal) and `/identity/registration` (full Kratos UI). Reuses `CrdKratosFlow` and the form wrappers.

5. **Password recovery + set-new-password** (P3) — the two-stage flow + cooldown logic stays in the integration layer; CRD card just renders `submitDisabled` + `submitLabelOverride`.

6. **Email verification + reminder** (P3) — relatively small; reuses the shell and CrdKratosFlow.

7. **Auth-error fallback** (P4) — simplest; static CRD card with translated copy and a back-to-sign-in button.

8. **Translations completeness** — populate all six languages for every key introduced.

9. **Analytics + APM wiring** — verify parity with MUI by side-by-side instrumentation check.

10. **Tests** — unit tests for each new CRD component (loading, error, submit states), integration tests for the route components mounting + adapter correctness.

## Open Questions Resolved During Planning (see research.md for full rationale)

- **Loading state UX during Kratos flow fetch** → minimal centred skeleton card; matches the perceived weight of the MUI `Loading` component used by `LoginRoute`.
- **`PasswordField` placement** → `src/crd/forms/PasswordField.tsx` (form-field wrapper layer), not `primitives/`. It is a labelled, error-aware composition of the `input` primitive plus a `lucide-react` eye icon, which makes it a forms-layer concern.
- **`CrdKratosFlow` placement** → `src/crd/components/auth/CrdKratosFlow.tsx`. It is an auth-feature composite, not a generic primitive, and lives alongside the screens that use it.
- **Auth routing** → `IdentityRoute.tsx` renders the CRD auth route components directly. The auth routes are not conditional — authentication screens are shown before any user context exists, so there is nothing to vary them by. The old MUI auth page components become orphaned (kept as dead code, deleted in a follow-up cleanup). Full rationale in research.md R-7.
- **Flow-descriptor shape** → see `data-model.md`. Loose-typed enough to round-trip every node type the live Kratos backend can return today; tight-typed enough that the CRD layer never has to import `@ory/kratos-client`.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Kratos backend returns a node type / group not covered by the adapter | Low | Medium | Adapter falls back to a generic "default text input" rendering so unknown nodes degrade gracefully rather than disappear; logged via existing Sentry. |
| Visual drift between login (icon-row) and registration (full-width row) for OIDC/passkey | Medium | Low | `CrdKratosFlow` accepts a `flowType` prop and applies the same conditional layout the MUI `KratosUI` already encodes; both modes are covered by component tests. |
| The 30-second recovery cooldown sessionStorage logic regresses | Low | Medium | Cooldown logic stays untouched in the integration layer (lift from `RecoveryPage.tsx`); the CRD card receives `submitDisabled` + `submitLabelOverride` as props. |
| Accepted-terms checkbox session-state workaround (Kratos resets on validation error) breaks for the curated `SignUp.tsx` path | Medium | Medium | Mirror the existing sessionStorage-by-flow-id approach in the new integration layer; covered by an integration test that simulates a validation error and confirms the checkbox stays checked. |
| Analytics events emit twice (once from a shared upstream + once from the new screens) when the user is on CRD | Medium | Low | Audit each MUI page's emit site during research; document exactly which events fire from page-level vs. KratosUI vs. wrapper, and replicate at exactly one site in the CRD path. |
| Auth screens (CRD) and the post-login app (possibly still MUI) use different designs — brief visual seam | High (by design) | Low | Accepted and expected. The auth screens have one design for every visitor; the post-login app design is a separate, pre-existing concern. The seam disappears once the rest of the app is migrated. |

## Phase 0: Research

See [research.md](./research.md) for full notes on:
- The MUI auth-page structural inventory (already mapped during clarification — included verbatim).
- The CRD design-system inventory (primitives present, form-field wrappers to build).
- The Kratos `UiNode` shape and how the adapter normalises it.
- The decision matrix for plan-level open questions.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

See:
- [data-model.md](./data-model.md) — `KratosFlowDescriptor` shape, `SocialProvider` shape, view-model shapes for every screen.
- [contracts/crd-auth-components.ts](./contracts/crd-auth-components.ts) — TypeScript interfaces for every new CRD presentational component (props in, callbacks out).
- [contracts/flow-descriptor.ts](./contracts/flow-descriptor.ts) — TypeScript interface for the adapter output (the contract between integration layer and CRD layer).
- [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md) — how to enable, run, and verify the CRD auth flow end-to-end against the live backend.
